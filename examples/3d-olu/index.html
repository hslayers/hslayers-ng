  <meta name="description" content="This application visualises the Open Land Use dataset on top of the EU-DEM terrain model in a perspective view. Displaying the data in 3D environment helps the user to explore an area of interest in more natural way than a traditional map. Moreover, the user can explore other datasets (such as OTM or SPOI) or even add a web map service of his choice (as long as the WMS is in WGS84 coordinate system) to make custom 3D mash-ups. The technical details can be found here.

The application was developed by the DataBio project team, for the purposes of the  INSPIRE HACK 2017.
