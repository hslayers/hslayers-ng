# HSLayers-NG mapping library

HSLayers-NG is a library which extends OpenLayers 6 functionality by providing a foundation to build map GUI and extra components such as layer manager, permalink generating, styling of vector features, including OpenGISÂ® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS) layers to the map in a user friendly way etc.  

Check out the examples to get an idea:

## Before You Start
HSLayers-NG is built on top of two major things: [OpenLayers](openlayers.org) library and [AngularJS](angularjs.org) framework. So in order to work with HSLayers you should have some understanding of both.
OpenLayers has a nice [tutorial workshop](https://openlayers.org/workshop/) to start with.

## Getting Started

After successfully installing [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) along with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), run the following in terminal:

`npm install hslayers-ng`


Include the bundle file

```<script src="node_modules/hslayers-ng/dist/hslayers-ng.js"></script>```

### Configure the application

A global hslayersNgConfig function, which returns a configuration object, needs to be created before loading the hslayers-ng.js script. It returns a json object to configure applications looks, behaviour and data. See [Configuration options](https://github.com/hslayers/hslayers-ng/wiki/Config-parameters) for the available options.

```
<script>
    function hslayersNgConfig(ol) {
      return {
        default_layers: [
          new ol.layer.Tile({
            source: new ol.source.OSM(),
            title: "OpenStreetMap",
            base: true,
            visible: true,
            removable: false
          })
        ],

        default_view: new ol.View({
          center: ol.proj.transform([17.474129, 52.574000], 'EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857'), //Latitude longitude    to Spherical Mercator
          zoom: 4,
          units: "m"
        })
      }
    } 
  </script>
  ```

Include in your html file, where the map should appear. 

```
<div hs ng-app="hs" ng-controller="Main" style="position: relative;"></div>
```

To have more customization options which require programming you can also write your own entry module which in this example is named app.js, but can have any other file name. 
App.js file is where you specify which hslayers modules will be loaded for your speciffic 
application, which map layers will be displayed and other configuration parameters. 
You can also write some startup code here to load a map service, open some initial panels etc.

Some example html files are provided in https://github.com/hslayers/examples repository. The template app.js uses 
png icons for layer groups which are included in https://github.com/hslayers/examples/tree/master/full directory.

Hslayers exposes Openlayers as global 'ol' variable and 'angular', which are used in defining modules, layers and configuration.

Following example uses html:

```
 <script src="node_modules/hslayers-ng/dist/hslayers-ng.js"></script>
 <script src="app.js"></script>
 <div hs ng-app="hs" ng-controller="Main" style="position: relative;"></div>
```

And app.js with explanations:

```
var module = angular.module('hs', [
    'hs.sidebar',
    'hs.toolbar',
    'hs.layermanager',
    'hs.map',
    'hs.query',
    'hs.search', 'hs.print', 'hs.permalink', 'hs.measure',
    'hs.legend', 'hs.geolocation', 'hs.core',
    'hs.datasource_selector',
    'hs.save-map',
    'hs.ows',
    'gettext',
    'hs.compositions',
    'hs.info'
]);

module.directive('hs',  function (HsCore) {
    'ngInject';
    return {
        template: HsCore.hslayersNgTemplate,
        link: function (scope, element) {
            HsCore.fullScreenMap(element);
        }
    };
});

module.value('HsConfig', {
    open_lm_after_comp_loaded: true,
    layer_order: '-position',
    box_layers: [
        new ol.layer.Group({
            'img': 'osm.png',
            title: 'Base layer',
            layers: [
                new ol.layer.Tile({
                    source: new ol.source.OSM(),
                    title: "OpenStreetMap",
                    base: true,
                    visible: true,
                    removable: false
                }),
                new ol.layer.Tile({
                    title: "OpenCycleMap",
                    visible: false,
                    base: true,
                    source: new ol.source.OSM({
                        url: 'http://{a-c}.tile.opencyclemap.org/cycle/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'
                    })
                })
            ],
        })
    ],
    default_view: new ol.View({
        center: ol.proj.transform([17.474129, 52.574000], 'EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857'), //Latitude longitude    to Spherical Mercator
        zoom: 4,
        units: "m"
    })
});

module.controller('Main', function ($scope, HsLayoutService) {
        'ngInject';
        layoutService.sidebarRight = false;
    }
);
```

For webpack bundling instructions see [Building with webpack](https://github.com/hslayers/hslayers-ng/wiki/Building-with-webpack)

### Proxy
To overcome CORS issues when adding external datasources, querying feature info or searching, we use a proxy. 
Hslayers-ng bundles two proxy solutions inside its lib directory. We recommend Nodejs based solution which is based on [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere).
To start it run: 

```npm explore hslayers-ng -- npm run start-hsl-proxy```

Another possibility is to use a python cgi script, which you have to copy from `lib/hsproxy.cgi` 
to your cgi-bin directory. It might be located in /usr/lib/ if you use Apache.

```
cp lib/hsproxy.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/hsproxy.cgi
```

To enable cgi on ubuntu, use

```
sudo a2enmod cgi
sudo service apache2 restart
```

If you are using nginx, see [HsProxy configuration with uwsgi](https://github.com/hslayers/hslayers-ng/wiki/Hsproxy-configuration)

### Run the Application

If you dont plan to develop hslayers-ng, dont want to run tests and and server files through npm managed 
http server, then you can skip all the following `npm` related steps.

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server, but you can always use a different web server.  
The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/`.


### Running Unit Tests

See [Testing](https://github.com/hslayers/hslayers-ng/wiki/Testing).

## Translating
Run 
```
grunt nggettext_extract
```
from terminal to generate po file template in /po/template.po and for each example eg. examples/pilsen_traffic/template.pot .
Rename it to *.po, translate, generate mo file and compile it.
If you are using specific translations for your app or example merge the global po file into the specific one with msgcat before compiling. 
Compiling is done with 
```
grunt nggettext_compile
```
It will generate components/translations/js/translations.js or examples/pilsen_traffic/translations.js files.

translations.js which contains the strings and also translating functionality is loaded by default like any other angular module from components/translations/js/translations.js in HsCore module. To have it use your own generated translations.js file override the path in hslayers.js file:
```
translations: hsl_path + 'examples/pilsen_traffic/translations' 
```
## Updating AngularJS

You can update all dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```
